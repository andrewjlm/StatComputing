A series of functions and programs that I created for a Statistics Computing course I took in Fall 2015. The course used Julia, which I had no experience with prior to the course. For reasons of compatibility with the GACRC cluster at the UGA, these programs were created to work in Julia v0.3.11. Because the language is still in such rapid development, they may not work with versions after that (and in fact there are significant changes that I would make to take advantage of features that were introduced in v0.4!).
